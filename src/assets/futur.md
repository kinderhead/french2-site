## **Le futur simple**

The Future Simple tense is a way to talk about things that will happen in the future. The Future Simple can be used for all things that have not happened yet, but the general rule is to use the Near Future for things up to two weeks away and use the Future Simple for everything after that. The Future simple is a simple tense, meaning that there is only one word being used. To make the Future Simple simply take the verb in the infinitive (if it is an RE remove the E) and add the correct ending.
