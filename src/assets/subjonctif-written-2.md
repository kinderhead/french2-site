## **Le subjonctif**

On a sheet of paper write five sentences using the subjunctive mood
(include a variety of pronouns to practice verb endings).

After you finish your sentences, hand it to a partner and have them
rewrite the sentence, translate it to English, and then choose two of
them to negate.

Now swap the order and have your partner write the sentences.
