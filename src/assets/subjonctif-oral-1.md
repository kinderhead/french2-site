## **Le subjonctif**

Write three sentences about what you think you will do, using "Il faut
que". Read them aloud for oral pronunciation practice.

Bonus Activity! See if you can come up with sentences off the top of
your head. See how quickly and correctly you say them by
taking turns with a partner.
